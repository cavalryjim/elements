= Elements CMS

What started out as a small framework for creating pages that were 
related, soon became much more. The result is a framework for 
creating websites which is incredibly powerful whether you want 
a simple 3 page site, or a full online shop with hundreds of 
products Elements CMS will suit.

== Standing on the shoulders of giants

Driven by pure passion for programming Elements prides itself on 
pure elegant solutions, utilising some of the best open source
software available. Add to this a little elements magic and you
have a very flexible and dynamic framework. One that trys to
stay out of your way, but make web site management as easy as
drag and drop.

== Getting Started

Right now, Elements is Rails app, so just download run migrations,
head to localhost and hack away to your hearts content.
Plans for the future are to turn what you have now into a rails
machine, so should you wish to pack this into your existing rails
app you can. We'll see how much interest there is for this before
we go down that road of course.

== Whats it all about

Ok so here's a list of the tricks Element CMS can do:

Manage Domains (site)
Manage Pages
Manage Pictures
Manage Text
Manage Gallery (simple mode)
Semantic Forms - Formtastic
User Permissions
User Management (no admin)


== Roadmap to 1.0

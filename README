== Elements CMS

What started out as a small framework for creating pages that were 
related, soon became much more. The result is a framework for 
creating websites which is incredibly powerful whether you want 
a simple 3 page site, or a full online shop with hundreds of 
products Elements will suit. What it isn't is yet another 
CMS with forum thrown in. If you want one of those, look elsewhere.
Also, this system is designed for GEEKS. If you have trouble
using it, its because you're not one! Get over it.
